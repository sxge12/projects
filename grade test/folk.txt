The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond: By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes, Where the sun shines bright
on Loch Lomond, Where me and my true love were ever won't to gae, On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch
Lomond.
Auld Lang Syne: Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be
forgot, And auld lang syne?
